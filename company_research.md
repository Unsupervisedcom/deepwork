## Company Overview

Loyal is a clinical-stage biotech company developing the first FDA-approved drugs to extend the lifespan and healthspan of dogs. Founded in 2019 by Celine Halioua at age 25, the company is pioneering longevity medicine—starting with dogs, with eventual plans to apply learnings to humans.

The company's thesis: dogs are the ideal model for longevity research because they share our environment, get similar age-related diseases, and have much shorter lifespans (making clinical trials feasible). If they succeed, Loyal will have the first drug approved for longevity in any species, including humans.

Loyal is backed by $150M+ from investors including Valor Equity Partners, Collaborative Fund, First Round Capital, and others. They're running the largest veterinary clinical trial in history.
