## Company Overview

Stand Insurance is a startup property insurer providing homeowners insurance for climate-exposed properties—specifically homes in California wildfire zones and Florida hurricane areas that traditional insurers won't cover or charge unaffordable rates.

Founded in 2024 by a team of Silicon Valley veterans, Stand uses physics-based AI models to build "digital twins" of properties and simulate how extreme weather would impact them. This approach has never been used before in the insurance industry and allows them to accurately price risk that others can't.

The company emerged from stealth with $30M in funding, backing from top-tier reinsurers, and an AM Best A- rating. They've since raised a $35M Series B to expand into Florida. They currently insure properties valued at over $1 billion total in wildfire-prone California.

## Product & Technology

**Core Innovation**: Physics-driven AI risk modeling
- Creates digital twins of properties using remote sensing data
- Simulates how wind, heat, embers, and other factors contribute to damage
- Collects homeowner details (window materials, tree species, etc.)
- Produces customized fire resilience plans for each property

**Target Market**:
- Higher-end homes in California ($1B+ total insured value)
- Properties that can't get affordable coverage elsewhere due to wildfire/hurricane risk
- Expanding to Florida for hurricane coverage

**Go-to-Market**: E&S (Excess and Surplus) broker model—working with brokers who specialize in hard-to-place risks
