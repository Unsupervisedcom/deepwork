      Review the changed files for requirements traceability.

      This project keeps formal requirements in `specs/` using the naming pattern
      `REQ-NNN-<topic>.md` with individually numbered requirements (e.g. REQ-001.1).
      Tests live in `tests/` and reference requirement IDs via docstrings and
      traceability comments.

      For this review:
      1. Check that any new or changed end-user functionality has a corresponding
         requirement in `specs/`.
      2. Check that every requirement touched by this change has at least one
         automated test referencing it in `tests/`.
      3. Flag any test modifications where the underlying requirement did not
         also change.
      4. Verify traceability comments are present and correctly reference
         requirement IDs.

      Produce a structured review with Coverage Gaps, Test Stability Violations,
      Traceability Issues, and a Summary with PASS/FAIL verdicts.
