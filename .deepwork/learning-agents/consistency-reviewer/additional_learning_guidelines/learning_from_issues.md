When incorporating learnings for the consistency-reviewer:

- **Prefer topics over learnings** for new conventions or pattern updates. If the codebase has evolved a new standard, update the relevant topic (or create a new one) rather than creating a learning about a specific incident.
- **Use learnings** for subtle judgment calls — cases where the "right" answer required understanding context beyond pure pattern matching. These narrative post-mortems help the agent develop better judgment.
- **Update core-knowledge.md** when a fundamental principle changes (e.g., a new required section in step instructions, or a change to the field ordering convention).
- **Keep severity calibration current**: If the agent consistently over-flags or under-flags certain issue types, adjust the Decision Frameworks section in core-knowledge.md.
