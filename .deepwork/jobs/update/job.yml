summary: "Update standard jobs in src/ and sync to installed locations"
description: |
  A workflow for maintaining standard jobs bundled with DeepWork. Standard jobs
  (like `deepwork_jobs` and `deepwork_rules`) are source-controlled in
  `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/` and must be edited there—never in `.deepwork/jobs/`
  or `.claude/commands/` directly.

  This job identifies which standard jobs to update from conversation context, makes
  changes in the correct source location, and propagates them via `deepwork install`.
  Use this whenever you need to modify job.yml files, step instructions, or hooks
  for any standard job in the DeepWork repository.

changelog:
  - version: "1.0.0"
    changes: "Initial job creation"
  - version: "1.1.0"

          1. Changes were made in src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/ (NOT in .deepwork/jobs/)
          2. `deepwork install --platform claude` was run
          3. Files in .deepwork/jobs/ match the source files
          4. Command files in .claude/commands/ were regenerated
          If ALL criteria are met, include `<promise>✓ Quality Criteria Met</promise>`.
