# Update Standard Job

## Objective

Edit standard job source files in `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/` and sync changes to installed locations (`.deepwork/jobs/` and command directories).

## Task

When working in the DeepWork repository and you need to modify a standard job, this step ensures changes are made in the correct location and properly propagated.

### Important: Source of Truth

Standard jobs exist in THREE locations, but only ONE is the source of truth:

| Location | Purpose | Editable? |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job]/` | **Source of truth** | **YES** |
| `.deepwork/jobs/[job]/` | Installed copy | NO - overwritten by install |
| `.claude/commands/[job].[step].md` | Generated commands | NO - regenerated by sync |

**NEVER edit files in `.deepwork/jobs/` or `.claude/commands/` for standard jobs!**

### Process

#### 1. Identify the Standard Job to Update

From the conversation context, determine:
- Which standard job needs updating (e.g., `deepwork_jobs`, `deepwork_policy`)
- What specific changes are needed (job.yml, step instructions, hooks, etc.)

Current standard jobs:
- `deepwork_jobs` - Core job management (define, implement, learn)
- `deepwork_policy` - Policy enforcement system

To check what standard jobs exist:
```bash
ls src/deepwork/standard_jobs/
```

#### 2. Make Changes in Source Location

Navigate to the source directory and make your changes:

```
src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/
├── job.yml              # Job definition
├── steps/               # Step instruction files
│   └── [step].md
├── hooks/               # Hook scripts (if any)
└── templates/           # Templates (if any)
```

**Examples of common edits:**
- Modify `job.yml` to add/change steps, update stop_hooks, or adjust metadata
- Edit `steps/[step].md` to improve instructions
- Add new hook scripts in `hooks/`

#### 3. Run DeepWork Install

After making changes, run install to propagate them:

```bash
deepwork install --platform claude
```

This copies files from `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/` to `.deepwork/jobs/` and regenerates command files.

If you also need Gemini support:
```bash
deepwork install --platform gemini
```

#### 4. Verify the Sync

Check that changes propagated correctly:

**Verify job.yml:**
```bash
diff src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/job.yml .deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/job.yml
```

**Verify step files:**
```bash
diff -r src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/steps/ .deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/steps/
```

**Check command files were regenerated:**
```bash
ls -la .claude/commands/[job_name].*.md
```

#### 5. Document the Changes

Create `sync_verification.md` documenting:
- What was changed
- Which files were modified
- Verification results

## Output Format

### sync_verification.md

```markdown
# Sync Verification Report

## Job Updated
[job_name]

## Changes Made
- [List each file modified in src/deepwork/standard_jobs/]
- [Describe what was changed]

## Install Command
```
deepwork install --platform claude
```

## Verification Results

### Source → .deepwork/jobs/ sync
- [x] job.yml matches
- [x] steps/ files match
- [x] hooks/ files match (if applicable)

### Command Generation
- [x] .claude/commands/[job].[step].md regenerated

## Summary
All changes successfully propagated from source to installed locations.
```

## Quality Criteria

- Changes were made ONLY in `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/` (never in `.deepwork/jobs/`)
- `deepwork install --platform claude` was executed successfully
- Files in `.deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/` match the source files
- Command files in `.claude/commands/` were regenerated
- `sync_verification.md` documents all changes and confirms sync status
- When all criteria are met, include `<promise>✓ Quality Criteria Met</promise>` in your response

## Context

This job exists specifically for maintaining the DeepWork project itself. Standard jobs are bundled with DeepWork and distributed to users when they run `deepwork install`. By keeping the source of truth in `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/`, we ensure:

1. Changes are tracked in version control properly
2. The install command always has the latest version
3. Users get consistent, tested job definitions
4. We don't accidentally edit installed copies that get overwritten

This workflow is critical for anyone contributing to DeepWork's built-in job definitions.
