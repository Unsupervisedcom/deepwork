  A workflow for preparing and committing code changes with quality checks.

  The **full** workflow starts with a code review to catch issues early, runs tests until
  they pass, formats and lints code with ruff, then reviews changed files
  before committing and pushing. The review and lint steps use sub-agents
  to reduce context usage.

  Steps:
  1. review - Code review for issues, DRY opportunities, naming, and test coverage (runs in sub-agent)
  2. test - Pull latest code and run tests until they pass
  3. lint - Format and lint code with ruff (runs in sub-agent)
  4. commit_and_push - Review changes and commit/push
