  A workflow for preparing and committing code changes with quality checks.

  This job runs tests until they pass, formats and lints code with ruff,
  then reviews changed files before committing and pushing. The lint step
  uses a sub-agent to reduce context usage.

  Steps:
  1. test - Pull latest code and run tests until they pass
  2. lint - Format and lint code with ruff (runs in sub-agent)
  3. commit_and_push - Review changes and commit/push

changelog:
  - version: "1.0.1"
    changes: "Changed file review from user confirmation to agent self-verification - agent now checks files match its own expectations instead of asking user every time"
  - version: "1.0.0"
    changes: "Initial job creation"

            Verify the tests are passing:
            1. Latest code was pulled from the branch
            2. All tests completed successfully
            3. No test failures or errors remain
            4. Test output shows passing status
            If ALL criteria are met, include `<promise>✓ Quality Criteria Met</promise>`.
