summary: "Creates and manages multi-step AI workflows. Use when defining, implementing, testing, or improving DeepWork jobs."
description: |
  Core commands for managing DeepWork jobs. These commands help you define new multi-step
  workflows, test them on real use cases, and learn from running them.

  The `new_job` workflow guides you through the full lifecycle of creating a new job:
  1. **Define**: Gather requirements through structured questions and create job.yml
  2. **Implement**: Generate step instruction files and sync slash commands
  3. **Test**: Run the workflow on a real use case, critique output, and iterate with user
  4. **Iterate**: Review what happened and improve the job definition based on learnings

  The `learn` skill reflects on conversations where DeepWork jobs were run, identifies
  confusion or inefficiencies, and improves job instructions. It also captures bespoke
  learnings specific to the current run into AGENTS.md files in the working folder.
