      When GitHub Actions workflow files (.github/workflows/*.yml) change, check whether
      .github/workflows/README.md needs updating.

      Pay attention to:
      - Workflow overview table (are all workflows listed? Are descriptions accurate?)
      - Merge queue strategy description (does it match the actual triggers?)
      - Skip pattern table (does it match actual workflow behavior?)
      - Any workflow-specific documentation sections

      Flag any sections that are now outdated or inaccurate due to the changes.
      If the README itself was changed, verify the updates are correct.
