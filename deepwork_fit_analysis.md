# DeepWork Fit Analysis: Stand Insurance

## Summary
- **Fit Score**: Strong
- **Best Positioning**: "You're 13 people building physics-based AI for climate risk—systematize the research and monitoring that feeds your models"
- **Primary Hook**: "You're tracking wildfires, hurricanes, and regulatory changes across two states. That's a lot to re-explain to Claude every week."

## Why DeepWork Resonates for Stand

Stand is the ideal DeepWork customer: 13-person team, technical founder, AI-native product, and operating in a domain (climate/catastrophe insurance) where staying current on research and regulations is existential. Dan Preston has CS degrees from Stanford, published research in astrophysics and computer vision—he'll appreciate the architecture.

The company is tracking an enormous amount of signal: wildfire patterns, climate research, regulatory changes in California and Florida, competitor moves in insurtech, and broker landscape shifts. With 13 people wearing many hats, these research and monitoring workflows are likely done ad-hoc rather than systematically.

The timing is perfect: LA wildfires just put Stand in the spotlight (CNBC feature), they're expanding to Florida, and the climate insurance space is evolving weekly. DeepWork's "define once, run consistently" model fits a team that needs rigorous monitoring but doesn't have bandwidth for manual process.

## Likely Workflows

### High-Value Workflows (Lead with these)
| Workflow | Frequency | Current Owner | Pain Level | DeepWork Value |
|----------|-----------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Climate/catastrophe monitoring** | Daily/Weekly | Dan or ops | High | Track wildfires, hurricanes, climate news, NOAA data automatically |
| **Regulatory intelligence** | Weekly | Ops/legal | High | Monitor CA and FL insurance regulations, DOI announcements |
| **Insurtech competitive research** | Monthly | Dan or BD | Medium | Track competitors (Hippo, Kin, Lemonade), funding, product launches |
| **Investor updates** | Monthly | Dan | Medium | Pull metrics, summarize milestones, draft consistent updates for 13 investors |
| **Broker outreach/research** | Ongoing | Sales | Medium | Research E&S brokers, track relationships, systematize outreach |

### Secondary Workflows
- **Florida market expansion research**: Deep dives on hurricane patterns, Florida regulatory landscape, local broker ecosystem
- **Board deck preparation**: Quarterly structured process for board materials
- **Property risk documentation**: Summarize risk analyses for underwriting (may be automated already)
- **Press/media preparation**: With CNBC spotlight, likely getting more press inquiries

## Positioning Strategy

### Primary Angle
"You're 13 people tracking wildfires, hurricane patterns, two states' worth of regulations, and a fast-moving insurtech landscape. DeepWork lets you define those monitoring workflows once and run them with a slash command. Same rigor, no re-explaining."

### Secondary Angles
- **Climate intelligence angle**: "Your product is physics-based AI for climate risk. Your internal research should be just as systematic. Define your climate monitoring workflow once, run it every Monday."
- **Founder bandwidth angle**: "You just got featured on CNBC, you're expanding to Florida, and you're still 13 people. Let DeepWork handle the recurring research so you can focus on the fires (literally)."
- **Regulatory rigor angle**: "Insurance is heavily regulated. Your regulatory monitoring should be consistent and documented. DeepWork creates an audit trail of what you tracked and when."

### What NOT to Lead With
- Don't focus on software dev workflows—Stand is insurtech, not pure software
- Don't undersell the complexity—Dan has Stanford CS, astrophysics research, he appreciates sophisticated tools
- Don't ignore the timing—LA wildfires just happened, this is extremely relevant right now

## Potential Objections & Responses
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're a 13-person startup, we don't have time for process" | "That's exactly the point—you don't have time to re-explain your research process every week. Define it once, run it forever." |
| "Our models are proprietary, we can't share data with AI" | "DeepWork runs on your local Claude Code—nothing leaves your machine. And it's for research/monitoring workflows, not your core IP." |
| "We're too busy with the LA wildfire response" | "Which is why you need systematic monitoring instead of ad-hoc. Define your climate intel workflow now, run it every week without thinking." |
| "We already track this stuff" | "The question is whether you track it the same way every time. DeepWork ensures consistency—same sources, same analysis, same format." |

## Recommended Demo Workflow

**Workflow name**: `/climate_intel`

**Why this demo**: Stand's entire business is predicting climate risk. Staying current on wildfires, hurricanes, climate research, and regulatory changes is existential. This workflow is immediately useful, tied directly to their core business, and shows how DeepWork systematizes exactly what they need.

**Proposed steps**:
1. `/climate_intel.scan` → Scan for wildfire/hurricane news, NOAA updates, climate research → `weekly_scan.md`
2. `/climate_intel.regulatory` → Check CA and FL DOI announcements, regulatory changes → `regulatory_update.md`
3. `/climate_intel.analyze` → Analyze implications for Stand's risk models and markets → `implications.md`
4. `/climate_intel.briefing` → Generate executive briefing for leadership team → `briefing.md`

**Alternative demo options**:
1. **`/insurtech_monitor`**: Track competitors (Hippo, Kin, Lemonade), funding news, product launches. Appeals to competitive positioning.
2. **`/investor_update`**: Pull metrics → summarize → draft update. With 13 investors, consistent updates matter.
