  A workflow for preparing and committing code changes with quality checks.

  This job starts with a code review to catch issues early, runs tests until
  they pass, formats and lints code, then reviews changed files before
  committing and pushing. The review and lint steps use sub-agents to reduce
  context usage.

  Steps:
  1. review - Code review for issues, DRY opportunities, naming, and test coverage (runs in sub-agent)
  2. test - Pull latest code and run tests until they pass
  3. lint - Format and lint code (runs in sub-agent)
  4. commit_and_push - Review changes and commit/push

changelog:
  - version: "1.0.0"
    changes: "Initial library version - generalized from project-specific commit workflow"

            Verify the code review is complete:
            1. Changed files were identified
            2. Sub-agent reviewed the code for general issues, DRY opportunities, naming clarity, and test coverage
            3. All identified issues were addressed or documented as intentional
