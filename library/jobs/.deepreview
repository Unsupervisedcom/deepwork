      When library job files change, check whether library/jobs/README.md needs updating.

      Pay attention to:
      - Job structure description (does it match the actual job.yml format?)
      - Usage instructions (do they reference current CLI commands?)
      - Directory structure listing (does it match what's actually in library/jobs/?)

      Flag any sections that are now outdated or inaccurate.
