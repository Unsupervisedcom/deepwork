      When library job files change, check whether library/jobs/README.md needs updating.

      Pay attention to:
      - Job structure description (does it match the actual job.yml format?)
      - Usage instructions (do they reference current CLI commands?)
      - Directory structure listing (does it match what's actually in library/jobs/?)

      Flag any sections that are now outdated or inaccurate.

      Pass this review if the README accurately reflects the current state of
      all changed files. Fail if any section of the README is factually outdated
      or references files, commands, or structures that no longer exist.

      For each issue, state the README section name and what is outdated or incorrect.
