If you need anything else related to the same topics from that agent, `resume` the same task rather than starting a new one — this preserves context and produces better results.

If the agent made a mistake or underperformed your expectations, either:
1. **Resume** the conversation explaining the issue and asking for corrected output/action, or
2. Invoke `/learning-agents:report_issue <agentId> <details of the issue>`
