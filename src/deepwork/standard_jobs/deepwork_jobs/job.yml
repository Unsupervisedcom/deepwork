  Core commands for managing DeepWork jobs. These commands help you define new multi-step
  workflows and refine existing ones.

  The `define` command guides you through an interactive process to create a new job by
  asking detailed questions about your workflow, understanding each step's inputs and outputs,
  and generating all necessary files.

  The `refine` command helps you modify existing jobs safely by understanding what you want
  to change, validating the impact, and ensuring consistency across your workflow.
