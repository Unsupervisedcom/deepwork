name: deepwork_rules
version: "0.3.0"
summary: "Rules enforcement for AI agent sessions"
description: |
  Manages rules that automatically trigger when certain files change during an AI agent session.
  Rules help ensure that code changes follow team guidelines, documentation is updated,
  and architectural decisions are respected.

  IMPORTANT: Rules are evaluated at the "Stop" hook, which fires when an agent finishes its turn.
  This includes when sub-agents complete their work. Rules are NOT evaluated immediately after
  each file edit - they batch up and run once at the end of the agent's response cycle.
  - Command action rules: Execute their command (e.g., `uv sync`) when the agent stops
  - Prompt action rules: Display instructions to the agent, blocking until addressed

  Rules are stored as individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `.deepwork/rules/`
  directory. Each rule file specifies:
  - Detection mode: trigger/safety, set (bidirectional), or pair (directional)
  - Patterns: Glob patterns for matching files, with optional variable capture
  - Action type: prompt (default) to show instructions, or command to run a shell command
  - Instructions: Markdown content describing what the agent should do

  Example use cases:
  - Update installation docs when configuration files change
  - Require security review when authentication code is modified
  - Ensure API documentation stays in sync with API code
  - Enforce source/test file pairing
  - Auto-run `uv sync` when pyproject.toml changes (command action)
