# DeepWork Policy Configuration
#
# Policies are automated guardrails that trigger when specific files change.
# They help ensure documentation stays current, security reviews happen, etc.
#
# Use /deepwork_policy.define to create new policies interactively.
#
# Format:
#   - name: "Friendly name for the policy"
#     trigger: "glob/pattern/**/*"  # or array: ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
#     safety: "pattern/**/*"        # optional - if these also changed, skip the policy
#     compare_to: "base"            # optional: "base" (default), "default_tip", or "prompt"
#     instructions: |
#       Multi-line instructions for the AI agent...
#
# Example policies (uncomment and customize):
#
# - name: "README Documentation"
#   trigger: "src/**/*"
#   safety: "README.md"
#   instructions: |
#     Source code has been modified. Please review README.md for accuracy:
#     1. Verify the project overview reflects current functionality
#     2. Check that usage examples are still correct
#     3. Ensure installation/setup instructions remain valid
#
# - name: "API Documentation Sync"
#   trigger: "src/api/**/*"
#   safety: "docs/api/**/*.md"
#   instructions: |
#     API code has changed. Please verify that API documentation is up to date:
#     - New or changed endpoints
#     - Modified request/response schemas
#     - Updated authentication requirements
#
# - name: "Security Review for Auth Changes"
#   trigger:
#     - "src/auth/**/*"
#     - "src/security/**/*"
#   instructions: |
#     Authentication or security code has been changed. Please:
#     1. Review for hardcoded credentials or secrets
#     2. Check input validation on user inputs
#     3. Verify access control logic is correct
#
# - name: "Test Coverage for New Code"
#   trigger: "src/**/*.py"
#   safety: "tests/**/*.py"
#   instructions: |
#     New source code was added. Please ensure appropriate test coverage:
#     1. Add unit tests for new functions/methods
#     2. Update integration tests if behavior changed
#     3. Verify all new code paths are tested
