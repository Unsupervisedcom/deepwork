Template: skill-deepwork.md.jinja
Purpose: Generates the main /deepwork skill that instructs agents to use MCP tools

This template is used to create the entry-point skill for DeepWork.
Instead of containing step instructions, it directs agents to use the
DeepWork MCP server tools.

# DeepWork Workflow Manager

Execute multi-step workflows with quality gate checkpoints.

## Terminology

A **job** is a collection of related **workflows**. For example, a "code_review" job
might contain workflows like "review_pr" and "review_diff". Users may use the terms
"job" and "workflow" somewhat interchangeably when describing the work they want done —
use context and the available workflows from `get_workflows` to determine the best match.

> **IMPORTANT**: Use the DeepWork MCP server tools. All workflow operations
> are performed through MCP tool calls and following the instructions they return,
> not by reading instructions from files.

## How to Use

1. Call `get_workflows` to discover available workflows
2. Call `start_workflow` with goal, job_name, and workflow_name
3. Follow the step instructions returned
4. Call `finished_step` with your outputs when done
5. Handle the response: `needs_work`, `next_step`, or `workflow_complete`

## Creating New Jobs

<important>
You MUST create new DeepWork jobs by starting the `new_job` workflow via the DeepWork
MCP tools. Follow the guidance from the DeepWork MCP server as you go through the
workflow — it will walk you through each step.
</important>

To create a new job, use the MCP tools:

1. Call `get_workflows` to confirm the `deepwork_jobs` job is available
2. Call `start_workflow` with:
   - `job_name`: `"deepwork_jobs"`
   - `workflow_name`: `"new_job"`
   - `goal`: a description of what the new job should accomplish
   - `instance_id`: a short name for the new job (e.g., `"code_review"`)
3. Follow the instructions returned by the MCP tools as you progress through the workflow

## Intent Parsing

When the user invokes `/deepwork`, parse their intent:
1. **ALWAYS**: Call `get_workflows` to discover available workflows
2. Based on the available flows and what the user said in their request, proceed:
    - **Explicit workflow**: `/deepwork <a workflow name>` → start the `<a workflow name>` workflow
    - **General request**: `/deepwork <a request>` → infer best match from available workflows
    - **No context**: `/deepwork` alone → ask user to choose from available workflows
