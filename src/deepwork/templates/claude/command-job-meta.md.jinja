# {{ job_name }}

You are executing the **{{ job_name }}** job. {{ job_summary }}

{% if job_description %}
{{ job_description }}
{% endif %}

## Available Steps

This job has {{ total_steps }} step(s):

{% for step in steps %}
### {{ step.id }}
**{{ step.name }}**: {{ step.description }}
- Command: `{{ step.command_name }}`
{% if step.dependencies %}
- Requires: {{ step.dependencies | join(', ') }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Instructions

This is a **multi-step workflow**. Determine the starting point and run through the steps in sequence.

1. **Analyze user intent** from the text that follows `/{{ job_name }}`

2. **Identify the starting step** based on intent:
{% for step in steps %}
   - {{ step.id }}: {{ step.description }}
{% endfor %}

3. **Run the workflow** starting from the identified step:
   - Invoke the starting step using the Skill tool
   - When that step completes, **automatically continue** to the next step in the workflow
   - Continue until the workflow is complete or the user intervenes

4. **If intent is ambiguous**, ask the user which step to start from:
   - Present the available steps as numbered options
   - Use AskUserQuestion to let them choose

**Critical**:
- You MUST invoke each step using the Skill tool. Do not copy/paste step instructions.
- After each step completes, check if there's a next step and invoke it automatically.
- The workflow continues until all dependent steps are complete.
