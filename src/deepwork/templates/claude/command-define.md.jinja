# Define a New DeepWork Job

This command helps you create a new multi-step workflow (job) for DeepWork.

## What is a Job?

A job is a reusable, multi-step workflow that guides you through complex tasks. Examples:
- Competitive research
- Feature development
- Monthly reporting
- Ad campaign creation
- Research paper writing

## Job Structure

Each job consists of:
- **Job metadata**: Name, version, description
- **Steps**: Individual tasks with clear inputs and outputs
- **Dependencies**: Which steps must complete before others

## Creating a Job

### Step 1: Plan Your Workflow

Think through the major phases of your work:
1. What are the distinct stages?
2. What outputs does each stage produce?
3. What dependencies exist between stages?

### Step 2: Create Job Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/steps
```

### Step 3: Create job.yml

Create `.deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/job.yml`:

```yaml
name: [job_name]
version: "1.0.0"
description: "[Brief description of what this workflow accomplishes]"

steps:
  - id: [step_id]
    name: "[Step Name]"
    description: "[What this step does]"
    instructions_file: steps/[step_id].md
    inputs:
      - name: [param_name]
        description: "[What user needs to provide]"
      # OR for file inputs from previous steps:
      # - file: [filename]
      #   from_step: [previous_step_id]
    outputs:
      - [output_filename]
    dependencies: []  # List of step IDs that must complete first

  - id: [another_step]
    name: "[Another Step]"
    description: "[What this step does]"
    instructions_file: steps/[another_step].md
    inputs:
      - file: [output_filename]
        from_step: [step_id]
    outputs:
      - [another_output]
    dependencies:
      - [step_id]  # This step requires the previous step
```

### Step 4: Create Step Instructions

For each step, create `.deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/steps/[step_id].md`:

```markdown
# [Step Name]

## Objective
[Clear statement of what this step accomplishes]

## Task
[Detailed instructions for completing this step]

### Process
1. [Substep 1]
2. [Substep 2]
3. [Substep 3]

## Output Format

### [output_filename]
[Description of the expected output]

```markdown
[Example or template of the output]
```

## Quality Criteria
- [Quality check 1]
- [Quality check 2]
```

### Step 5: Validate and Sync

```bash
# Sync to generate slash-commands
deepwork sync

# Your commands will be available as:
# /[job_name].[step_id]
```

## Example

Here's a simple two-step job:

```yaml
name: blog_post
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Create a blog post from outline to final draft"

steps:
  - id: outline
    name: "Create Outline"
    description: "Create a structured outline for the blog post"
    instructions_file: steps/outline.md
    inputs:
      - name: topic
        description: "The blog post topic"
      - name: target_audience
        description: "Who is the target audience"
    outputs:
      - outline.md
    dependencies: []

  - id: draft
    name: "Write Draft"
    description: "Write the full blog post draft from the outline"
    instructions_file: steps/draft.md
    inputs:
      - file: outline.md
        from_step: outline
    outputs:
      - draft.md
    dependencies:
      - outline
```

## Tips

- **Keep steps atomic**: Each step should do one thing well
- **Clear outputs**: Every step should produce reviewable artifacts
- **Logical dependencies**: Steps should build on each other
- **User parameters**: Use when you need information from the user
- **File inputs**: Use when you need outputs from previous steps

## Validation Rules

- Job name: lowercase, underscores allowed (e.g., `my_job`)
- Version: semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- Step IDs: unique within the job
- Dependencies: must reference existing step IDs
- File inputs: `from_step` must be in dependencies
- At least one output per step
- No circular dependencies

## After Creating Your Job

Run `deepwork sync` to generate slash-commands, then use:
```
/[job_name].[first_step_id]
```
