You are executing the **update** job. Update standard jobs in src/ and sync to installed locations

A workflow for maintaining standard jobs bundled with DeepWork. Standard jobs
(like `deepwork_jobs` and `deepwork_policy`) are source-controlled in
`src/deepwork/standard_jobs/` and must be edited there—never in `.deepwork/jobs/`
or `.claude/commands/` directly.

This job guides you through:
1. Identifying which standard job(s) to update from conversation context
2. Making changes in the correct source location (`src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/`)
3. Running `deepwork install` to propagate changes to `.deepwork/` and command directories
4. Verifying the sync completed successfully

Use this job whenever you need to modify job.yml files, step instructions, or hooks
for any standard job in the DeepWork repository.


## Available Steps

This job has 1 step(s):

### job
**Update Standard Job**: Edit standard job source files and sync to installed locations
- Command: `/update:uw.job`

## Instructions

This is a **multi-step workflow**. Determine the starting point and guide the user through the steps in sequence.

1. **Analyze user intent** from the text that follows `/update`

2. **Identify the starting step** based on intent:
   - job: Edit standard job source files and sync to installed locations

3. **Guide the user through the workflow**:
   - Tell the user to run the starting step command
   - After each step completes, guide them to the next step in the workflow
   - Continue until the workflow is complete

   Step commands:
   - job: `/update:uw.job`

4. **If intent is ambiguous**, ask the user which step to start from:
   - Present the available steps as numbered options
   - Let them choose

**Note**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step completes, remind the user to run the next step command.
