**Step 2 of 3** in the **founder_outreach** workflow

**Summary**: Generate personalized DeepWork outreach for target founders

## Job Overview

A workflow for creating compelling, personalized outreach to convince founders
to try DeepWork. This job researches a target company, analyzes where DeepWork
would fit their workflows, and generates customized email, SMS, and demo ideas.

The workflow produces:
- Comprehensive company research summary
- Analysis of DeepWork fit and relevant workflows
- Personalized email, SMS options, and a custom demo concept

Designed for founder-to-founder outreach where the target is likely a power user
of AI coding tools like Claude Code or OpenCode.


## Prerequisites

This step requires completion of the following step(s):
- `/founder_outreach:research`

Please ensure these steps have been completed before proceeding.

## Instructions

# Analyze DeepWork Fit

## Objective
Analyze the target company's profile to identify where DeepWork would add value, what workflows they likely have, and how to position it for maximum resonance.

## Prerequisites
This step requires:
- `company_research.md` from the research step

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting, read the DeepWork context file to understand what DeepWork is and how to identify good workflows:
- Read: `.deepwork/jobs/founder_outreach/context/deepwork_overview.md`

## What is DeepWork? (Quick Reference)

DeepWork transforms complex multi-step tasks into reusable slash commands for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.).

**How it works:**
1. Define a workflow once in YAML (steps, inputs, outputs)
2. DeepWork generates slash commands (e.g., `/competitive_research.identify_competitors`)
3. Execute via AI assistant - outputs go to Git branches, everything versioned

**Key insight**: "Stop re-explaining multi-step workflows to your AI. Define once, execute forever."

## Task Description

Read the company research and analyze:
1. Why DeepWork would resonate with this company specifically
2. What repetitive workflows they likely have (be specific to their business)
3. What pain points DeepWork solves for them
4. The best positioning angle for outreach
5. What demo workflow would resonate most

## What Makes a Workflow "DeepWork-able"

**Good fit:**
- Multi-step (3-7 steps ideal)
- Repeatable (done more than once)
- Has clear inputs/outputs (files, reports, decisions)
- Benefits from consistency
- Currently manual or inconsistent (no one owns it, or founder does it ad-hoc)

**Bad fit:**
- One-off tasks
- Highly creative with no structure
- Real-time human judgment at every step
- Simple tasks that don't need a workflow

## DeepWork Value Propositions

**For Small Teams (< 20 people)**
- "Build lightweight processes without scaling headcount"
- "A 5-person team operating with 50-person rigor"
- "Can't afford to hire for process, can't afford to half-ass it"

**For AI-Native Companies**
- "You're building AI for customers—are you using AI systematically internally?"
- "Meta angle: AI workflows to build AI products"

**For Technical Founders (Claude Code users)**
- "You're already using Claude Code—this makes it 10x more powerful"
- "Define once, execute forever via slash commands"

**For Fast-Moving Startups**
- "Stop re-explaining processes every time"
- "Build institutional knowledge into your AI workflows"

## Common Workflow Categories

Identify which of these the target company likely has. **Be specific to their business**—don't just list generic categories.

| Category | Examples | Typical Frequency |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Research** | Competitive intel, market research, customer research | Quarterly |
| **Reporting** | Investor updates, board decks, metrics dashboards | Weekly/Monthly |
| **Content** | Marketing materials, sales collateral, case studies | Ongoing |
| **Ops** | New hire onboarding, compliance evidence gathering | Per event |
| **DevOps** | Deployment, monitoring, cloud cost management | Daily/Weekly |
| **Sales** | Lead research, proposal generation, pipeline reports | Daily |
| **Ad Ops** | Pull reports → analyze → suggest changes → execute | Daily |

## Real Use Cases We're Running

Reference these when identifying workflows:
1. **Marketing materials with accuracy checks** - Generate content → validation step checks for accuracy
2. **DevOps automation** - Deployment workflows, monitoring setup, incident response
3. **Bug discovery → code agent** - Find bugs → auto-kick off agent to fix
4. **Founder outreach** (this job!) - Research → analyze fit → generate outreach

## Analysis Framework

For each relevant workflow, evaluate:
- **Frequency**: How often? (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly)
- **Current Owner**: Who does it? (Founder? Employee? No one?)
- **Pain Level**: How painful is it manually? (High = good DeepWork fit)
- **DeepWork Value**: How specifically would DeepWork help?

## Demo Workflow Criteria

The demo recommendation should be:
- **Universally relatable** - They definitely do this (every founder does competitive research)
- **Immediately useful** - They walk away with real, usable output
- **Shows the "aha"** - Define once → slash commands → Git-native outputs
- **Appropriate length** - 3-5 steps, ~20 min to demo
- **Specific to them** - Not generic, tied to their business

**Example of a good demo workflow:**

`/competitive_intel` (4 steps):
1. `/competitive_intel.identify` → `competitors.md`
2. `/competitive_intel.deep_dive` → `competitor_profiles/`
3. `/competitive_intel.matrix` → `comparison_matrix.md`
4. `/competitive_intel.briefing` → `competitive_briefing.md`

## Output Format

Create `deepwork_fit_analysis.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# DeepWork Fit Analysis: [Company Name]
