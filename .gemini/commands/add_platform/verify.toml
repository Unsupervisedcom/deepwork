**Step 4 of 4** in the **add_platform** workflow

**Summary**: Add a new AI platform to DeepWork with adapter, templates, and tests

## Job Overview

A workflow for adding support for a new AI platform (like Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) to DeepWork.

This job guides you through four phases:
1. **Research**: Capture the platform's CLI configuration and hooks system documentation
2. **Add Capabilities**: Update the job schema and adapters with any new hook events
3. **Implement**: Create the platform adapter, templates, tests (100% coverage), and README updates
4. **Verify**: Ensure installation works correctly and produces expected files

The workflow ensures consistency across all supported platforms and maintains
comprehensive test coverage for new functionality.

**Important Notes**:
- Only hooks available on slash command definitions should be captured
- Each existing adapter must be updated when new hooks are added (typically with null values)
- Tests must achieve 100% coverage for any new functionality
- Installation verification confirms the platform integrates correctly with existing jobs


## Prerequisites

This step requires completion of the following step(s):
- `/add_platform:implement`

Please ensure these steps have been completed before proceeding.

## Instructions

# Verify Installation

## Objective

Ensure the new platform integration works correctly by setting up necessary directories and running the full installation process.

## Task

Perform end-to-end verification that the new platform can be installed and that DeepWork's standard jobs work correctly with it.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the implementation step is complete:
- Adapter class exists in `src/deepwork/adapters.py`
- Templates exist in `src/deepwork/templates/<platform_name>/`
- Tests pass with 100% coverage
- README.md is updated

### Process

1. **Set up platform directories in the DeepWork repo**

   The DeepWork repository itself should have the platform's command directory structure for testing:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p <platform_command_directory>
   ```

   For example:
   - Claude: `.claude/commands/`
   - Cursor: `.cursor/commands/` (or wherever Cursor stores commands)

2. **Run deepwork install for the new platform**

   ```bash
   deepwork install --platform <platform_name>
   ```

   Verify:
   - Command completes without errors
   - No Python exceptions or tracebacks
   - Output indicates successful installation

3. **Check that command files were created**

   List the generated command files:
   ```bash
   ls -la <platform_command_directory>/
   ```

   Verify:
   - `deepwork_jobs.define.md` exists (or equivalent for the platform)
   - `deepwork_jobs.implement.md` exists
   - `deepwork_jobs.refine.md` exists
   - `deepwork_policy.define.md` exists
   - All expected step commands exist

4. **Validate command file content**

   Read each generated command file and verify:
   - Content matches the expected format for the platform
   - Job metadata is correctly included
   - Step instructions are properly rendered
   - Any platform-specific features (hooks, frontmatter) are present

5. **Test alongside existing platforms**

   If other platforms are already installed, verify they still work:
   ```bash
   deepwork install --platform claude
   ls -la .claude/commands/
   ```

   Ensure:
   - New platform doesn't break existing installations
   - Each platform's commands are independent
   - No file conflicts or overwrites

6. **Document verification results**

   Create a verification report documenting what was tested and the results.

## Output Format

### verification_complete.md

Location: `deepwork/add_platform/verification_complete.md` (in work directory)

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Platform Verification Complete: <platform_name>

## Summary

**Platform**: <platform_name>
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: PASSED / FAILED

## Installation Test

### Command Executed
```bash
deepwork install --platform <platform_name>
```

### Result
- Exit code: 0
- Errors: None
- Warnings: [any warnings]

## Generated Files

### Command Directory: <path>

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| deepwork_jobs.define.md | Created | [size, any notes] |
| deepwork_jobs.implement.md | Created | [size, any notes] |
| deepwork_jobs.refine.md | Created | [size, any notes] |
| deepwork_policy.define.md | Created | [size, any notes] |

## Content Validation

### Sample Command File Review

**File**: deepwork_jobs.define.md

- [ ] Correct frontmatter/metadata for platform
- [ ] Job summary included
- [ ] Step instructions rendered correctly
- [ ] Platform-specific hooks present (if applicable)

### Format Compliance

- [ ] Files match platform's expected command format
- [ ] No template rendering errors
- [ ] All placeholders resolved

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Other Platforms Tested

| Platform | Still Works | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| claude | Yes/No | [any issues] |

## Conclusion

[Summary of verification results and any recommendations]

## Next Steps

- [ ] Platform is ready for use
- [ ] Consider adding to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Update any additional documentation
```

## Quality Criteria

- Platform-specific directories are set up in the DeepWork repo
- `deepwork install --platform <platform_name>` completes without errors
- All expected command files are created:
  - deepwork_jobs.define, implement, refine
  - deepwork_policy.define
  - Any other standard job commands
- Command file content is correct:
  - Matches platform's expected format
  - Job/step information is properly rendered
  - No template errors or missing content
- Existing platforms still work (if applicable)
- No conflicts between platforms
- `verification_complete.md` documents all test results
- When all criteria are met, include `<promise>QUALITY_COMPLETE</promise>` in your response

## Context

This is the final validation step before the platform is considered complete. A thorough verification ensures:
- The platform actually works, not just compiles
- Standard DeepWork jobs install correctly
- The platform integrates properly with the existing system
- Users can confidently use the new platform

Take time to verify each aspect - finding issues now is much better than having users discover them later.

## Common Issues to Check

- **Template syntax errors**: May only appear when rendering specific content
- **Path issues**: Platform might expect different directory structure
- **Encoding issues**: Special characters in templates or content
- **Missing hooks**: Platform adapter might not handle all hook types
- **Permission issues**: Directory creation might fail in some cases


## Inputs


### Required Files

This step requires the following files from previous steps:
- `templates/` (from step `implement`)
  Location: `deepwork/add_platform/templates/`

Make sure to read and use these files as context for this step.

## Work Branch Management

All work for this job should be done on a dedicated work branch:

1. **Check current branch**:
   - If already on a work branch for this job (format: `deepwork/add_platform-[instance]-[date]`), continue using it
   - If on main/master, create a new work branch

2. **Create work branch** (if needed):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b deepwork/add_platform-[instance]-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```
   Replace `[instance]` with a descriptive identifier (e.g., `acme`, `q1-launch`, etc.)

3. **All outputs go in the work directory**:
   - Create files in: `deepwork/add_platform/`
   - This keeps work products organized by job

## Output Requirements

Create the following output(s) in the work directory:
- `deepwork/add_platform/verification_complete.md`

Ensure all outputs are:
- Well-formatted and complete
- Committed to the work branch
- Ready for review or use by subsequent steps

## Completion

After completing this step:

1. **Commit your work**:
   ```bash
   git add deepwork/add_platform/
   git commit -m "add_platform: Complete verify step"
   ```

2. **Verify outputs**: Confirm all required files have been created

3. **Inform the user**:
   - Step 4 of 4 is complete
   - Outputs created: verification_complete.md
   - This is the final step - the job is complete!

## Workflow Complete

This is the final step in the add_platform workflow. All outputs should now be complete and ready for review.

Consider:
- Reviewing all work products in `deepwork/add_platform/`
- Creating a pull request to merge the work branch
- Documenting any insights or learnings
