**Standalone command** in the **deepwork_jobs** job - can be run anytime

**Summary**: DeepWork job management commands

## Job Overview

Core commands for managing DeepWork jobs. These commands help you define new multi-step
workflows and learn from running them.

The `define` command guides you through an interactive process to create a new job by
asking detailed questions about your workflow, understanding each step's inputs and outputs,
and generating all necessary files.

The `learn` command reflects on conversations where DeepWork jobs were run, identifies
confusion or inefficiencies, and improves job instructions. It also captures bespoke
learnings specific to the current run into AGENTS.md files in the working folder.



## Instructions

# Learn from Job Execution

## Objective

Reflect on the conversation to identify learnings from DeepWork job executions, improve job instructions with generalizable insights, and capture bespoke (run-specific) learnings in AGENTS.md.

**Reference**: See `deepwork_jobs.md` for job structure and templates.

## Task

Analyze conversation history to extract learnings:
- **Generalizable learnings** → Update job instruction files
- **Bespoke learnings** (specific to this run) → Add to AGENTS.md in working folder

### Step 1: Analyze Conversation

1. Scan for DeepWork slash commands (`/job_name.step_id`)
2. Identify working folder from conversation or `git diff`
3. If no job specified, ask user which job to analyze

### Step 2: Identify Issues

Look for:
- **Confusion** - Unnecessary questions, misunderstandings, incorrect outputs
- **Inefficiency** - Extra iterations, repeated information, missing context
- **Errors** - Failed validations, misunderstood criteria, unhandled edge cases
- **Successes** - What worked well, efficient approaches, good examples

### Step 3: Classify Learnings

**Generalizable** (update instructions):
- Helps ANY future run
- Fixes unclear/missing guidance
- Adds helpful examples
- Example: "Instructions should mention X format is required"

**Bespoke** (add to AGENTS.md):
- Specific to THIS project/codebase
- References local conventions/files
- Example: "API endpoints are in `src/api/`"

### Step 4: Update Instructions (Generalizable)

1. Edit `.deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/steps/[step_id].md`
2. Add missing context, examples, clarifications
3. Keep concise - avoid redundancy
4. Track changes for changelog

### Step 4b: Extract Shared Content

Review instruction files for duplicated or lengthy content. Extract to `.deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/steps/shared/`:
- `conventions.md` - Formatting conventions
- `examples.md` - Common examples
- `schemas.md` - Data structures

Reference from instructions: "Follow conventions in `shared/conventions.md`"

### Step 5: Create/Update AGENTS.md (Bespoke)

Place AGENTS.md in the working folder where job outputs live.

**Use file references** instead of duplicating content:
```markdown
# Good
- API endpoints follow REST conventions. See `src/api/routes.ts` for examples.

# Avoid
- API endpoints should return JSON with format: { status: ..., data: ... }
```

**Template**: See `.deepwork/jobs/deepwork_jobs/templates/agents.md.template`

### Step 6: Update Version and Changelog

If instructions modified:
1. Bump version in job.yml (patch for improvements, minor for criteria changes)
2. Add changelog entry

### Step 7: Sync and Relay

```bash
deepwork sync
```

Tell user how to reload commands.

## Quality Criteria

- Conversation analyzed for job executions
- Confusion and inefficiency identified
- Learnings correctly classified (generalizable vs bespoke)
- Instructions updated for generalizable improvements
- Instructions concise - no redundancy
- Shared content extracted where appropriate
- AGENTS.md created/updated with bespoke learnings
- File references used instead of duplicating content
- AGENTS.md in correct working folder
- When all criteria are met, include `<promise>✓ Quality Criteria Met</promise>`

## Edge Cases

- **No job executions found**: Ask which job to analyze
- **Multiple jobs**: Analyze each separately
- **AGENTS.md exists**: Append to appropriate sections
- **No issues found**: Document what worked well
- **Sensitive info**: Never include secrets/credentials - reference config files instead


## Inputs

### User Parameters

Please gather the following information from the user:
- **job_name**: Name of the job that was run (optional - will auto-detect from conversation)


## Work Branch Management

All work for this job should be done on a dedicated work branch:

1. **Check current branch**:
   - If already on a work branch for this job (format: `deepwork/deepwork_jobs-[instance]-[date]`), continue using it
   - If on main/master, create a new work branch

2. **Create work branch** (if needed):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b deepwork/deepwork_jobs-[instance]-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```
   Replace `[instance]` with a descriptive identifier (e.g., `acme`, `q1-launch`, etc.)

## Output Requirements

Create the following output(s):
- `AGENTS.md`

Ensure all outputs are:
- Well-formatted and complete
- Ready for review or use by subsequent steps

## Completion

After completing this step:

1. **Verify outputs**: Confirm all required files have been created

2. **Inform the user**:
   - The learn command is complete
   - Outputs created: AGENTS.md
   - This command can be run again anytime to make further changes

## Command Complete

This is a standalone command that can be run anytime. The outputs are ready for use.

Consider:
- Reviewing the outputs
- Running `deepwork sync` if job definitions were changed
- Re-running this command later if further changes are needed
