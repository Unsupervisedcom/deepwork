You are executing the **deepwork_policy** job. Policy enforcement for AI agent sessions

Manages policies that automatically trigger when certain files change during an AI agent session.
Policies help ensure that code changes follow team guidelines, documentation is updated,
and architectural decisions are respected.

Policies are defined in a `.deepwork.policy.yml` file at the root of your project. Each policy
specifies:
- Trigger patterns: Glob patterns for files that, when changed, should trigger the policy
- Safety patterns: Glob patterns for files that, if also changed, mean the policy doesn't need to fire
- Instructions: What the agent should do when the policy triggers

Example use cases:
- Update installation docs when configuration files change
- Require security review when authentication code is modified
- Ensure API documentation stays in sync with API code
- Remind developers to update changelogs


## Available Steps

This job has 1 step(s):

### define
**Define Policy**: Create or update policy entries in .deepwork.policy.yml
- Command: `/deepwork_policy:uw.define`

## Instructions

This is a **multi-step workflow**. Determine the starting point and guide the user through the steps in sequence.

1. **Analyze user intent** from the text that follows `/deepwork_policy`

2. **Identify the starting step** based on intent:
   - define: Create or update policy entries in .deepwork.policy.yml

3. **Guide the user through the workflow**:
   - Tell the user to run the starting step command
   - After each step completes, guide them to the next step in the workflow
   - Continue until the workflow is complete

   Step commands:
   - define: `/deepwork_policy:uw.define`

4. **If intent is ambiguous**, ask the user which step to start from:
   - Present the available steps as numbered options
   - Let them choose

**Note**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step completes, remind the user to run the next step command.
