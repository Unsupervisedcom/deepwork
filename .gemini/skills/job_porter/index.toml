**Multi-step workflow**: Helps users port DeepWork jobs between local and global locations

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.

This job assists users in managing job scope by porting jobs between local 
project-specific locations (.deepwork/jobs/) and global system-wide locations 
(~/.deepwork/jobs/). It guides users through discovering available jobs, 
understanding the differences between local and global scope, and safely 
migrating jobs between scopes.


## Available Steps

1. **list_jobs** - Shows all available jobs in both local and global locations with their current scope
   Command: `/job_porter:list_jobs`
2. **port_job** - Moves a job between local and global scope with safety validation
   Command: `/job_porter:port_job`
3. **explain_scopes** - Provides detailed explanation of local vs global jobs and when to use each
   Command: `/job_porter:explain_scopes`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/job_porter` to determine user intent:
- "list_jobs" or related terms → start at `/job_porter:list_jobs`
- "port_job" or related terms → start at `/job_porter:port_job`
- "explain_scopes" or related terms → start at `/job_porter:explain_scopes`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/job_porter:list_jobs
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
