**Multi-step workflow**: 

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.


## Available Steps

1. **define** - Create a workflow.yml by gathering requirements through structured questions
   Command: `/experts.define`
2. **review_workflow_spec** - Review workflow.yml against quality criteria using a sub-agent for unbiased validation (requires: define)
   Command: `/experts.review_workflow_spec`
3. **implement** - Generate step instruction files and sync skills from the validated workflow.yml (requires: review_workflow_spec)
   Command: `/experts.implement`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/` to determine user intent:
- "define" or related terms → start at `/experts.define`
- "review_workflow_spec" or related terms → start at `/experts.review_workflow_spec`
- "implement" or related terms → start at `/experts.implement`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/experts.define
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
