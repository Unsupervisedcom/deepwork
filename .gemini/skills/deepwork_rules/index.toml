**Multi-step workflow**: Rules enforcement for AI agent sessions

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.

Manages rules that automatically trigger when certain files change during an AI agent session.
Rules help ensure that code changes follow team guidelines, documentation is updated,
and architectural decisions are respected.

Rules are stored as individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `.deepwork/rules/`
directory. Each rule file specifies:
- Detection mode: trigger/safety, set (bidirectional), or pair (directional)
- Patterns: Glob patterns for matching files, with optional variable capture
- Instructions: Markdown content describing what the agent should do

Example use cases:
- Update installation docs when configuration files change
- Require security review when authentication code is modified
- Ensure API documentation stays in sync with API code
- Enforce source/test file pairing


## Available Steps

1. **define** - Create a new rule file in .deepwork/rules/
   Command: `/deepwork_rules:define`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/deepwork_rules` to determine user intent:
- "define" or related terms → start at `/deepwork_rules:define`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/deepwork_rules:define
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
