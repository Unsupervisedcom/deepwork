**Multi-step workflow**: Spec-driven development workflow that turns specifications into working implementations through structured planning.

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.

A comprehensive workflow inspired by GitHub's spec-kit that enables "spec-driven development" -
a methodology where executable specifications generate working implementations rather than
merely guiding them.

This job inverts traditional development: instead of starting with code, you first create
detailed specifications that directly generate implementations. The workflow progresses through
six phases:

1. **Constitution**: Establish project governance principles and development guidelines
2. **Specification**: Define functional requirements focusing on "what" and "why"
3. **Clarification**: Resolve ambiguities before technical planning
4. **Planning**: Create technical implementation strategy and architecture
5. **Task Generation**: Break plans into actionable, ordered development tasks
6. **Implementation**: Execute tasks to deliver the complete feature

The workflow produces all artifacts in a `specs/[feature-name]/` directory structure,
keeping specifications versioned alongside the implementation they generate.

Ideal for:
- New feature development requiring upfront design
- Complex features with multiple stakeholders
- Projects where specification quality directly impacts implementation success
- Teams wanting to capture design decisions for future reference


## Available Steps

1. **constitution** - Creates foundational governance principles and development guidelines for the project. Use when starting a new project or establishing standards.
   Command: `/spec_driven_development:constitution`
2. **specify** - Defines functional requirements as user stories without technology choices. Use when starting to design a new feature. (requires: constitution)
   Command: `/spec_driven_development:specify`
3. **clarify** - Resolves ambiguities and gaps in the specification through structured questioning. Use after specification to ensure completeness. (requires: specify)
   Command: `/spec_driven_development:clarify`
4. **plan** - Creates technical implementation strategy including architecture and technology choices. Use after specification is clarified. (requires: clarify, constitution)
   Command: `/spec_driven_development:plan`
5. **tasks** - Converts the implementation plan into actionable, ordered development tasks. Use after plan is validated. (requires: plan, clarify)
   Command: `/spec_driven_development:tasks`
6. **implement** - Generates code and assets by executing the task breakdown. Use when ready to build the feature. (requires: tasks, plan, clarify)
   Command: `/spec_driven_development:implement`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/spec_driven_development` to determine user intent:
- "constitution" or related terms → start at `/spec_driven_development:constitution`
- "specify" or related terms → start at `/spec_driven_development:specify`
- "clarify" or related terms → start at `/spec_driven_development:clarify`
- "plan" or related terms → start at `/spec_driven_development:plan`
- "tasks" or related terms → start at `/spec_driven_development:tasks`
- "implement" or related terms → start at `/spec_driven_development:implement`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/spec_driven_development:constitution
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
