**Multi-step workflow**: DeepWork job management commands

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.

Core commands for managing DeepWork jobs. These commands help you define new multi-step
workflows and learn from running them.

The `define` command guides you through an interactive process to create a new job by
asking structured questions about your workflow, understanding each step's inputs and outputs,
and generating all necessary files.

The `learn` command reflects on conversations where DeepWork jobs were run, identifies
confusion or inefficiencies, and improves job instructions. It also captures bespoke
learnings specific to the current run into AGENTS.md files in the working folder.


## Available Steps

1. **define** - Create the job.yml specification file by understanding workflow requirements
   Command: `/deepwork_jobs:define`
2. **implement** - Generate instruction files for each step based on the job.yml specification (requires: define)
   Command: `/deepwork_jobs:implement`
3. **learn** - Reflect on conversation to improve job instructions and capture learnings
   Command: `/deepwork_jobs:learn`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/deepwork_jobs` to determine user intent:
- "define" or related terms → start at `/deepwork_jobs:define`
- "implement" or related terms → start at `/deepwork_jobs:implement`
- "learn" or related terms → start at `/deepwork_jobs:learn`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/deepwork_jobs:define
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
