**Step 2/4** in **deepwork_jobs** workflow

> Creates and manages multi-step AI workflows. Use when defining, implementing, or improving DeepWork jobs.

## Prerequisites (Verify First)

Before proceeding, confirm these steps are complete:
- `/deepwork_jobs:define`

## Instructions

**Goal**: Reviews job.yml against quality criteria using a sub-agent for unbiased validation. Use after defining a job specification.

# Review Job Specification

## Objective

Review the `job.yml` created in the define step against the doc spec quality criteria using a sub-agent for unbiased evaluation, then iterate on fixes until all criteria pass.

## Why This Step Exists

The define step focuses on understanding user requirements. This review step ensures the specification meets quality standards before implementation. A sub-agent provides "fresh eyes" that catch issues the main agent might miss.

## Task

Use a sub-agent to review the job.yml against all 9 doc spec quality criteria, then fix any failed criteria.

### Process

1. **Read the files**
   - Read `.deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/job.yml`
   - Read `.deepwork/doc_specs/job_spec.md` for reference

2. **Spawn review sub-agent**
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: general-purpose` and `model: haiku`
   - Include the full job.yml content and all 9 quality criteria in the prompt
   - Request PASS/FAIL for each criterion with specific issues if failed

3. **Fix failed criteria**
   - Edit job.yml to address each failed criterion
   - Common fixes: shorten summary, add changelog, fix dependencies

4. **Re-run review if needed**
   - Spawn a new sub-agent with updated content
   - Repeat until all 9 criteria pass

5. **Confirm completion**
   - Announce "All 9 doc spec quality criteria pass"
   - Include `<promise>Quality Criteria Met</promise>`
   - Guide to next step: `/deepwork_jobs.implement`

### The 9 Quality Criteria

1. **Valid Identifier**: lowercase with underscores, no spaces
2. **Semantic Version**: X.Y.Z format
3. **Concise Summary**: under 200 characters
4. **Rich Description**: multi-line with problem/process/outcome/users
5. **Changelog Present**: array with at least initial version
6. **Complete Steps**: each has id, name, description, instructions_file, outputs, dependencies
7. **Valid Dependencies**: reference existing steps, no circular refs
8. **Input Consistency**: from_step must be in dependencies
9. **Output Paths**: valid filenames or paths

## Output

The validated `job.yml` file that passes all quality criteria.


### Job Context

Core commands for managing DeepWork jobs. These commands help you define new multi-step
workflows and learn from running them.

The `new_job` workflow guides you through defining and implementing a new job by
asking structured questions about your workflow, understanding each step's inputs and outputs,
reviewing the specification, and generating all necessary files.

The `learn` skill reflects on conversations where DeepWork jobs were run, identifies
confusion or inefficiencies, and improves job instructions. It also captures bespoke
learnings specific to the current run into AGENTS.md files in the working folder.


## Required Inputs


**Files from Previous Steps** - Read these first:
- `job.yml` (from `define`)

## Work Branch

Use branch format: `deepwork/deepwork_jobs-[instance]-YYYYMMDD`

- If on a matching work branch: continue using it
- If on main/master: create new branch with `git checkout -b deepwork/deepwork_jobs-[instance]-$(date +%Y%m%d)`

## Outputs

**Required outputs**:
- `job.yml`
  **Doc Spec**: DeepWork Job Specification
  > YAML specification file that defines a multi-step workflow job for AI agents
  **Definition**: `.deepwork/doc_specs/job_spec.md`
  **Target Audience**: AI agents executing jobs and developers defining workflows
  **Quality Criteria**:
  1. **Valid Identifier**: Job name must be lowercase with underscores, no spaces or special characters (e.g., `competitive_research`, `monthly_report`)
  2. **Semantic Version**: Version must follow semantic versioning format X.Y.Z (e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.3`)
  3. **Concise Summary**: Summary must be under 200 characters and clearly describe what the job accomplishes
  4. **Rich Description**: Description must be multi-line and explain: the problem solved, the process, expected outcomes, and target users
  5. **Changelog Present**: Must include a changelog array with at least the initial version entry. Changelog should only include one entry per branch at most
  6. **Complete Steps**: Each step must have: id (lowercase_underscores), name, description, instructions_file, outputs (at least one), and dependencies array
  7. **Valid Dependencies**: Dependencies must reference existing step IDs with no circular references
  8. **Input Consistency**: File inputs with `from_step` must reference a step that is in the dependencies array
  9. **Output Paths**: Outputs must be valid filenames or paths within the main repo directory structure, never in dot-directories like `.deepwork/`. Use specific, descriptive paths that lend themselves to glob patterns (e.g., `competitive_research/acme_corp/swot.md` or `operations/reports/2026-01/spending_analysis.md`). Parameterized paths like `[competitor_name]/` are encouraged for per-entity outputs. Avoid generic names (`output.md`, `analysis.md`) and transient-sounding paths (`temp/`, `draft.md`). Supporting materials for a final output should go in a peer `_dataroom` folder (e.g., `spending_analysis_dataroom/`).
  10. **Concise Instructions**: The content of the file, particularly the description, must not have excessively redundant information. It should be concise and to the point given that extra tokens will confuse the AI.

## On Completion

1. Verify outputs are created
2. Inform user: "Step 2/4 complete, outputs: job.yml"
3. **Tell user next command**: `/deepwork_jobs:implement`
