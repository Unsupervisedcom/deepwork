**Step 2/4** in **deepwork_jobs** workflow

> Creates and manages multi-step AI workflows. Use when defining, implementing, or improving DeepWork jobs.

## Prerequisites (Verify First)

Before proceeding, confirm these steps are complete:
- `/deepwork_jobs:define`

## Instructions

**Goal**: Reviews job.yml against quality criteria using a sub-agent for unbiased validation. Use after defining a job specification.

# Review Job Specification

## Objective

Review the `job.yml` created in the define step against quality criteria using a sub-agent for unbiased evaluation, then iterate on fixes until all criteria pass.

## Why This Step Exists

The define step focuses on understanding user requirements. This review step ensures the specification meets quality standards before implementation. A sub-agent provides "fresh eyes" that catch issues the main agent might miss.

## Task

Use a sub-agent to review the job.yml against doc spec quality criteria, fix any failures, and repeat until all pass.

### Step 1: Read the Job Specification

Read both files:
- `.deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/job.yml` - The specification to review
- `.deepwork/doc_specs/job_spec.md` - The quality criteria

### Step 2: Spawn Review Sub-Agent

Use the Task tool with:
- `subagent_type`: "general-purpose"
- `model`: "haiku"
- `description`: "Review job.yml against doc spec"

**Sub-agent prompt**:

```
Review this job.yml against the following 9 quality criteria.

For each criterion, respond with PASS or FAIL.
If FAIL: provide the specific issue and suggested fix.

## job.yml Content

[paste full job.yml content]

## Quality Criteria

1. **Valid Identifier**: Job name lowercase with underscores (e.g., `competitive_research`)
2. **Semantic Version**: Format X.Y.Z (e.g., `1.0.0`)
3. **Concise Summary**: Under 200 characters, describes what job accomplishes
4. **Rich Description**: Multi-line explaining problem, process, outcomes, users
5. **Changelog Present**: Array with at least initial version entry
6. **Complete Steps**: Each has id, name, description, instructions_file, outputs, dependencies
7. **Valid Dependencies**: Reference existing step IDs, no circular references
8. **Input Consistency**: File inputs with `from_step` reference a step in dependencies
9. **Output Paths**: Valid filenames or paths

## Response Format

### Overall: [X/9 PASS]

### Criterion Results
1. Valid Identifier: [PASS/FAIL]
   [If FAIL: Issue and fix]
...

### Summary of Required Fixes
[List fixes needed, or "No fixes required"]
```

### Step 3: Review Findings

Parse the sub-agent's response:
1. Count passing criteria
2. Identify failures
3. Note suggested fixes

### Step 4: Fix Failed Criteria

Edit job.yml to address each failure:

| Criterion | Common Fix |
|-----------|-----------|
| Valid Identifier | Convert to lowercase_underscores |
| Semantic Version | Set to `"1.0.0"` or fix format |
| Concise Summary | Shorten to <200 chars |
| Rich Description | Add multi-line explanation |
| Changelog Present | Add `changelog:` array |
| Complete Steps | Add missing required fields |
| Valid Dependencies | Fix step ID reference |
| Input Consistency | Add referenced step to dependencies |
| Output Paths | Use valid filename/path format |

### Step 5: Re-Run Review (If Needed)

If any criteria failed:
1. Spawn a new sub-agent with updated job.yml
2. Review new findings
3. Fix remaining issues
4. Repeat until all 9 criteria pass

### Step 6: Confirm Completion

When all 9 criteria pass:

1. Announce: "All 9 doc spec quality criteria pass."
2. Include: `<promise>Quality Criteria Met</promise>`
3. Guide: "Run `/deepwork_jobs.implement` to generate step instruction files."

## Output

The validated `job.yml` file at `.deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/job.yml` passing all 9 quality criteria.


### Job Context

Core commands for managing DeepWork jobs. These commands help you define new multi-step
workflows and learn from running them.

The `new_job` workflow guides you through defining and implementing a new job by
asking structured questions about your workflow, understanding each step's inputs and outputs,
reviewing the specification, and generating all necessary files.

The `learn` skill reflects on conversations where DeepWork jobs were run, identifies
confusion or inefficiencies, and improves job instructions. It also captures bespoke
learnings specific to the current run into AGENTS.md files in the working folder.


## Required Inputs


**Files from Previous Steps** - Read these first:
- `job.yml` (from `define`)

## Work Branch

Use branch format: `deepwork/deepwork_jobs-[instance]-YYYYMMDD`

- If on a matching work branch: continue using it
- If on main/master: create new branch with `git checkout -b deepwork/deepwork_jobs-[instance]-$(date +%Y%m%d)`

## Outputs

**Required outputs**:
- `job.yml`
  **Doc Spec**: DeepWork Job Specification
  > YAML specification file that defines a multi-step workflow job for AI agents
  **Definition**: `.deepwork/doc_specs/job_spec.md`
  **Target Audience**: AI agents executing jobs and developers defining workflows
  **Quality Criteria**:
  1. **Valid Identifier**: Job name must be lowercase with underscores, no spaces or special characters (e.g., `competitive_research`, `monthly_report`)
  2. **Semantic Version**: Version must follow semantic versioning format X.Y.Z (e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.3`)
  3. **Concise Summary**: Summary must be under 200 characters and clearly describe what the job accomplishes
  4. **Rich Description**: Description must be multi-line and explain: the problem solved, the process, expected outcomes, and target users
  5. **Changelog Present**: Must include a changelog array with at least the initial version entry. Changelog should only include one entry per branch at most
  6. **Complete Steps**: Each step must have: id (lowercase_underscores), name, description, instructions_file, outputs (at least one), and dependencies array
  7. **Valid Dependencies**: Dependencies must reference existing step IDs with no circular references
  8. **Input Consistency**: File inputs with `from_step` must reference a step that is in the dependencies array
  9. **Output Paths**: Outputs must be valid filenames or paths within the main repo directory structure, never in dot-directories like `.deepwork/`. Use specific, descriptive paths that lend themselves to glob patterns (e.g., `competitive_research/acme_corp/swot.md` or `operations/reports/2026-01/spending_analysis.md`). Parameterized paths like `[competitor_name]/` are encouraged for per-entity outputs. Avoid generic names (`output.md`, `analysis.md`) and transient-sounding paths (`temp/`, `draft.md`). Supporting materials for a final output should go in a peer `_dataroom` folder (e.g., `spending_analysis_dataroom/`).
  10. **Concise Instructions**: The content of the file, particularly the description, must not have excessively redundant information. It should be concise and to the point given that extra tokens will confuse the AI.

## Quality Validation (Manual)

**NOTE**: Gemini CLI does not support automated validation. Manually verify criteria before completing.

**Criteria (all must be satisfied)**:
1. **Sub-Agent Used**: Was a sub-agent spawned to provide unbiased review?
2. **All doc spec Criteria Evaluated**: Did the sub-agent assess all 9 quality criteria?
3. **Findings Addressed**: Were all failed criteria addressed by the main agent?
4. **Validation Loop Complete**: Did the review-fix cycle continue until all criteria passed?
## On Completion

1. Verify outputs are created
2. Inform user: "Step 2/4 complete, outputs: job.yml"
3. **Tell user next command**: `/deepwork_jobs:implement`
