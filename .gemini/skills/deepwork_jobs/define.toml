**Step 1/4** in **deepwork_jobs** workflow

> Creates and manages multi-step AI workflows. Use when defining, implementing, or improving DeepWork jobs.


## Instructions

**Goal**: Creates a job.yml specification by gathering workflow requirements through structured questions. Use when starting a new multi-step workflow.

# Define Job Specification

## Objective

Create a `job.yml` specification file that defines the structure of a new DeepWork job by understanding the user's workflow requirements through interactive questions.

## Task

Guide the user through defining a job specification by asking structured questions. The output is **only** the `job.yml` file - step instruction files are created in the `implement` step.

### Process

1. **Understand the job purpose**
   - Ask structured questions about the overall goal, domain, and frequency
   - Understand what success looks like and who the audience is
   - Identify the major phases of the workflow

2. **Detect document-oriented workflows**
   - Look for patterns: "report", "summary", "monthly", "for stakeholders"
   - If detected, offer to create a doc spec for consistent quality
   - Use `.deepwork/doc_specs/job_spec.md` as a reference example

3. **Define each step**
   - For each phase, gather: purpose, inputs, outputs, dependencies
   - Ask about output file paths and organization
   - Consider whether steps need agent delegation

4. **Validate the workflow**
   - Summarize the complete workflow
   - Check for gaps in inputs/outputs between steps
   - Confirm job name, summary, and version

5. **Create the job specification**
   - Run `make_new_job.sh` to create directory structure:
     ```bash
     .deepwork/jobs/deepwork_jobs/make_new_job.sh [job_name]
     ```
   - Create `job.yml` at `.deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/job.yml`

### Key Guidelines

- **Ask structured questions** using the AskUserQuestion tool
- **Work products go in main repo**, not `.deepwork/` (for discoverability)
- **Use dates in paths** for periodic outputs that accumulate
- **Use `_dataroom` folders** for supporting materials
- Reference templates in `.deepwork/jobs/deepwork_jobs/templates/`

## Output

Create `.deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/job.yml` following the doc spec at `.deepwork/doc_specs/job_spec.md`.

After creating the file, tell the user to run `/deepwork_jobs.review_job_spec` next.


### Job Context

Core commands for managing DeepWork jobs. These commands help you define new multi-step
workflows and learn from running them.

The `new_job` workflow guides you through defining and implementing a new job by
asking structured questions about your workflow, understanding each step's inputs and outputs,
reviewing the specification, and generating all necessary files.

The `learn` skill reflects on conversations where DeepWork jobs were run, identifies
confusion or inefficiencies, and improves job instructions. It also captures bespoke
learnings specific to the current run into AGENTS.md files in the working folder.


## Required Inputs

**User Parameters** - Gather from user before starting:
- **job_purpose**: What complex task or workflow are you trying to accomplish?


## Work Branch

Use branch format: `deepwork/deepwork_jobs-[instance]-YYYYMMDD`

- If on a matching work branch: continue using it
- If on main/master: create new branch with `git checkout -b deepwork/deepwork_jobs-[instance]-$(date +%Y%m%d)`

## Outputs

**Required outputs**:
- `job.yml`
  **Doc Spec**: DeepWork Job Specification
  > YAML specification file that defines a multi-step workflow job for AI agents
  **Definition**: `.deepwork/doc_specs/job_spec.md`
  **Target Audience**: AI agents executing jobs and developers defining workflows
  **Quality Criteria**:
  1. **Valid Identifier**: Job name must be lowercase with underscores, no spaces or special characters (e.g., `competitive_research`, `monthly_report`)
  2. **Semantic Version**: Version must follow semantic versioning format X.Y.Z (e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.3`)
  3. **Concise Summary**: Summary must be under 200 characters and clearly describe what the job accomplishes
  4. **Rich Description**: Description must be multi-line and explain: the problem solved, the process, expected outcomes, and target users
  5. **Changelog Present**: Must include a changelog array with at least the initial version entry. Changelog should only include one entry per branch at most
  6. **Complete Steps**: Each step must have: id (lowercase_underscores), name, description, instructions_file, outputs (at least one), and dependencies array
  7. **Valid Dependencies**: Dependencies must reference existing step IDs with no circular references
  8. **Input Consistency**: File inputs with `from_step` must reference a step that is in the dependencies array
  9. **Output Paths**: Outputs must be valid filenames or paths within the main repo directory structure, never in dot-directories like `.deepwork/`. Use specific, descriptive paths that lend themselves to glob patterns (e.g., `competitive_research/acme_corp/swot.md` or `operations/reports/2026-01/spending_analysis.md`). Parameterized paths like `[competitor_name]/` are encouraged for per-entity outputs. Avoid generic names (`output.md`, `analysis.md`) and transient-sounding paths (`temp/`, `draft.md`). Supporting materials for a final output should go in a peer `_dataroom` folder (e.g., `spending_analysis_dataroom/`).
  10. **Concise Instructions**: The content of the file, particularly the description, must not have excessively redundant information. It should be concise and to the point given that extra tokens will confuse the AI.

## On Completion

1. Verify outputs are created
2. Inform user: "Step 1/4 complete, outputs: job.yml"
3. **Tell user next command**: `/deepwork_jobs:review_job_spec`
