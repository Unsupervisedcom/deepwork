**Multi-step workflow**: Update standard jobs in src/ and sync to installed locations

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.

A workflow for maintaining standard jobs bundled with DeepWork. Standard jobs
(like `deepwork_jobs` and `deepwork_rules`) are source-controlled in
`src/deepwork/standard_jobs/` and must be edited there—never in `.deepwork/jobs/`
or `.claude/commands/` directly.

This job identifies which standard jobs to update from conversation context, makes
changes in the correct source location, and propagates them via `deepwork install`.
Use this whenever you need to modify job.yml files, step instructions, or hooks
for any standard job in the DeepWork repository.


## Available Steps

1. **job** - Edit standard job source files and sync to installed locations
   Command: `/update:job`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/update` to determine user intent:
- "job" or related terms → start at `/update:job`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/update:job
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
