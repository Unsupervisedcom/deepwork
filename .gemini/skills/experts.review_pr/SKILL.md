**Multi-step workflow**: 

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.


## Available Steps

1. **check_relevance** - Invoke all experts in parallel to assess if PR changes are relevant to their domain
   Command: `/experts.check_relevance`
2. **deep_review** - Invoke only relevant experts to perform detailed code review (requires: check_relevance)
   Command: `/experts.deep_review`
3. **improve_and_rereview** - Apply expert feedback and re-run reviews until no further feedback or 3 iterations (requires: deep_review)
   Command: `/experts.improve_and_rereview`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/` to determine user intent:
- "check_relevance" or related terms → start at `/experts.check_relevance`
- "deep_review" or related terms → start at `/experts.deep_review`
- "improve_and_rereview" or related terms → start at `/experts.improve_and_rereview`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/experts.check_relevance
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
