## Email

**Subject**: Something for your longevity research firehose

Hey Celine,

You came to mind when we finished building this thing—mostly because I know you're drinking from a firehose trying to track papers, FDA moves, and competitors in a space that didn't exist five years ago.

We built DeepWork, which lets you define multi-step workflows once and then execute them via slash commands in Claude Code. Think: `/longevity_monitor.scan` runs your weekly research process, `/investor_update.draft` pulls metrics and drafts your monthly update—same quality every time, no re-explaining.

The thing that made me think of Loyal specifically: you're pioneering a new FDA category, which means every regulatory precedent matters. Seems like the kind of thing where "I'll just ask Claude" isn't rigorous enough—you need your AI following the exact same process every week.

We're using it for marketing content with accuracy checks, DevOps automation, and founder outreach (literally used it to write this email). Would love to show you how it works—20 min, I'll set up a longevity research workflow and run it live.

Down to take a look?

[Your name]

## SMS Options

**Option 1 (Direct)**:
"Hey—built something that turns multi-step workflows into slash commands for Claude Code. Thought of you bc tracking the longevity space seems like a perfect use case. 20 min demo?"

**Option 2 (Hook first)**:
"Random q: how much time do you spend re-explaining your research process to Claude? Built a thing that fixes that. Would love to show you"

**Option 3 (Ultra casual)**:
"Ok I need to show you this thing. It's workflow templates for Claude Code. Feels very relevant to drinking from the longevity research firehose"

## Demo Idea: Longevity Research Monitor

### The Hook
"You're tracking a space that's evolving weekly—new papers, competitor moves, FDA guidance. Let me show you how to systematize that into a workflow you run with one command."

### Workflow: `/longevity_monitor` (4 steps)

| Step | Command | What it does | Output |
|------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | `/longevity_monitor.scan` | Research latest longevity papers, funding news, FDA updates | `weekly_scan.md` |
| 2 | `/longevity_monitor.analyze` | Analyze implications for Loyal's programs | `implications.md` |
| 3 | `/longevity_monitor.competitive` | Update competitive landscape (Unity, Rejuvenate, etc.) | `competitive_update.md` |
| 4 | `/longevity_monitor.briefing` | Generate executive briefing for leadership/board | `briefing.md` |

### Demo Flow (20 min)

1. **(2 min)** Show the `job.yml` definition—"this is how you define a workflow, 4 steps with inputs and outputs"
2. **(5 min)** Run `/longevity_monitor.scan` live—watch Claude search for recent longevity news, papers, FDA updates
3. **(3 min)** Show the output on the Git branch—"everything's versioned, you can see exactly what was found"
4. **(5 min)** Run `/longevity_monitor.analyze`—show it reading the previous output and analyzing implications
5. **(5 min)** Show the final briefing output—"this is what you'd get every week, same format, same rigor"

### Why This Demo Works for Celine
- **Immediately relatable**: She's literally tracking a fast-moving space with new papers and competitors constantly
- **Shows the "aha"**: Define the research process once → run `/longevity_monitor.scan` every Monday
- **Appropriate complexity**: Biotech founder will appreciate the structure, not see it as overkill
- **Ties to her identity**: "SpaceX of aging" means rigorous processes—this delivers that
- **Produces real output**: She walks away with an actual longevity briefing she could use

### Alternative Demo Options
1. **`/investor_update`**: Pull metrics → summarize milestones → draft update → review checklist. With 38+ investors, she's probably writing a lot of updates. Shows how to systematize recurring communications.
2. **`/regulatory_intel`**: Track FDA guidance changes → analyze precedent → summarize implications. Appeals to "pioneering a new FDA category" angle—consistency in regulatory monitoring matters.

## Follow-up Notes
- Celine is active on Twitter/X—she might appreciate this as content fodder too ("how I systematize research with AI")
- The "SpaceX of aging" framing is her language—use it
- She's a technical founder (Longevity Fund background)—don't dumb down the explanation
- If she's skeptical about "another AI tool," emphasize it's NOT a new tool—it's a way to make Claude Code follow her exact processes
