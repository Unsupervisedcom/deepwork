**Subject**: Something for tracking the wildfire/climate firehose

Hey Dan,

Saw the CNBC piece after the LA fires—congrats on being in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. Also, I imagine you're drowning in signal right now: wildfire updates, regulatory changes, insurtech moves, Florida expansion research.

We built something that I think would click for you. It's called DeepWork—lets you define multi-step research workflows once, then execute them via slash commands in Claude Code. Think: `/climate_intel.scan` runs your weekly wildfire/hurricane monitoring, `/regulatory.check` tracks CA and FL DOI announcements—same rigor every time, no re-explaining.

The thing that made me think of Stand: you're 13 people building physics-based AI for climate risk. Your product is systematic and rigorous. Seems like your internal research should be too—but who has time to build that when you're also responding to the biggest wildfire season in years?

We're using it for marketing content with accuracy checks, competitive research, and founder outreach (used it to write this email). Would love to show you how it works—20 min, I'll set up a climate intel workflow and run it live.

Interested?

[Your name]

## SMS Options

**Option 1 (Direct)**:
"Hey—built something that turns research workflows into slash commands for Claude Code. Thought of you bc tracking wildfires + FL expansion + regulatory seems like a lot to re-explain every week. 20 min demo?"

**Option 2 (Hook first)**:
"Saw the CNBC piece—congrats. Random q: how are you keeping up with wildfire/hurricane intel across two states with 13 people? Built something that might help. Can I show you?"

**Option 3 (Ultra casual)**:
"Dude congrats on the CNBC thing. I need to show you this tool we built—it's workflow templates for Claude Code. Feels extremely relevant to your situation rn"

## Demo Idea: Climate Intelligence Monitor

### The Hook
"Your entire business is predicting climate risk. Let me show you how to systematize the research that feeds those predictions—wildfires, hurricanes, regulatory changes, all in one workflow you run with a single command."

### Workflow: `/climate_intel` (4 steps)

| Step | Command | What it does | Output |
|------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | `/climate_intel.scan` | Scan for wildfire/hurricane news, NOAA updates, climate research | `weekly_scan.md` |
| 2 | `/climate_intel.regulatory` | Check CA and FL DOI announcements, regulatory changes | `regulatory_update.md` |
| 3 | `/climate_intel.analyze` | Analyze implications for Stand's risk models and markets | `implications.md` |
| 4 | `/climate_intel.briefing` | Generate executive briefing for leadership team | `briefing.md` |

### Demo Flow (20 min)

1. **(2 min)** Show the `job.yml` definition—"this is how you define a 4-step climate monitoring workflow"
2. **(5 min)** Run `/climate_intel.scan` live—watch Claude search for recent wildfire news, NOAA data, climate research
3. **(3 min)** Show output on the Git branch—"everything's versioned, you can see exactly what was found and when"
4. **(5 min)** Run `/climate_intel.regulatory`—show it tracking CA and FL regulatory sources
5. **(5 min)** Show the final briefing output—"this is what you'd get every Monday, same format, same rigor"

### Why This Demo Works for Dan
- **Directly relevant**: His entire business is climate risk prediction
- **Immediately useful**: He's literally tracking this stuff right now with the LA fires
- **Shows the "aha"**: Define once → run `/climate_intel.scan` every Monday
- **Respects his technical depth**: Dan has Stanford CS, astrophysics research—he'll appreciate the architecture
- **Timely**: LA wildfires just happened, Florida expansion is underway, this is extremely relevant

### Alternative Demo Options
1. **`/insurtech_monitor`**: Track competitors (Hippo, Kin, Lemonade), funding news, product launches. Appeals to competitive positioning in a crowded space.
2. **`/florida_expansion`**: Deep dive on Florida market—hurricane patterns, regulatory landscape, broker ecosystem. Relevant to their announced expansion.

## Follow-up Notes
- Dan just got major press (CNBC)—he's probably slammed. Keep it short and punchy.
- Timing is perfect: LA wildfires literally just happened, everyone's talking about climate insurance
- His house was damaged in the 2020 CZU fire—this is personal for him
- Technical founder (Stanford CS, astrophysics)—don't dumb it down
- 13-person team is ideal size for "lightweight process without scaling headcount" pitch
